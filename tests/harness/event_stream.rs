#![allow(dead_code)]
//! Server-Sent Events client for the L2 SSE matrix.
//!
//! Wave 1 (`docs/development/commands/_general.md`) calls this out as the only hard
//! blocking item: the `tests/harness/code_session.rs` PTY harness has
//! always driven `/api/code/messages` and `/session`, but the matrix
//! roadmap needs a blocking SSE reader before any of the SSE / state /
//! generation / approval matrices can run.
//!
//! Design notes:
//!
//! * Use `reqwest::blocking` so the matrix runner stays synchronous
//!   like the rest of the L2 harness. The Worker UI's SSE wire format
//!   is plain `text/event-stream`, not framed JSON, so we own the
//!   parser instead of depending on an SSE crate.
//! * Read the underlying response on a worker thread that pushes
//!   parsed [`SseEvent`]s into an `mpsc::sync_channel`. Each call to
//!   [`EventStream::next_event`] then becomes a `recv_timeout` —
//!   per-call timeouts decouple cleanly from the request-level
//!   timeout we hand `reqwest`.
//! * Bound the parsed line buffer at 1 MiB so a runaway server can't
//!   exhaust the test process. Lines bigger than that abort the
//!   stream and the parser thread exits. The diagnostic is stored
//!   in a shared `last_error` slot so `next_event` surfaces it on
//!   disconnect even when a slow consumer fills the channel before
//!   the worker can enqueue the `EventOrError::Err`.
//! * EOF and timeout are distinct outcomes:
//!   * `Ok(None)` — no event arrived within the requested timeout
//!     (the underlying connection may still be open).
//!   * `Err(...)` — the connection ended (server closed, network
//!     error, line-too-long, etc.). Once an `Err` is returned the
//!     stream is poisoned and subsequent calls will keep returning
//!     `Err`.
//! * `keep-alive` heartbeats from axum's `Sse::keep_alive(...)` are
//!   surfaced as comments (`:` lines) and silently dropped; only
//!   real `event:`+`data:` blocks reach the channel.
//!
//! The public surface is intentionally small. Tests that care about
//! a specific event type use [`EventStream::next_event`] in a loop;
//! the matrix runner builds higher-level steps (`expect_event`,
//! `collect_events_until`) on top.
