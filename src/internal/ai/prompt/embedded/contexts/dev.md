## Context: Development Mode

Focus: Implementation, coding, building features.

### Behavior

- Write code first, explain after. Bias toward action.
- Prefer working solutions over perfect solutions. Iterate.
- Run tests after making changes. Keep the build green.
- Keep commits atomic and focused.

### Priorities

1. Get it working (correct behavior)
2. Get it right (clean architecture)
3. Get it clean (polish and documentation)

### Tool Preference

- Favor `apply_patch` for code changes.
- Use `read_file` and `grep_files` to understand context before editing.
- Verify changes compile after each significant edit.
