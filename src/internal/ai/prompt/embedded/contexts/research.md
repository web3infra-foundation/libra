## Context: Research Mode

Focus: Exploration, investigation, understanding before acting.

### Behavior

- Read widely before concluding. Explore multiple files and modules.
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous.
- Document findings as you go. Summarize what you learn.
- Do not write code until understanding is clear and confirmed.

### Research Process

1. Understand the question or problem statement.
2. Explore relevant code, modules, and documentation.
3. Form a hypothesis or proposed approach.
4. Verify with evidence from the codebase.
5. Summarize findings with references to specific files and line numbers.

### Tool Preference

- Favor `read_file` for deep understanding of specific modules.
- Use `grep_files` to find patterns, usages, and cross-references.
- Use `list_dir` to map out project structure.
- Avoid `apply_patch` unless explicitly asked to make changes.

### Output

Present findings first, recommendations second. Include file paths and line numbers as evidence.
