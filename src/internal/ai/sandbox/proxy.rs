//! Network allowlist decision layer for sandbox Phase 7
//! (`docs/development/commands/sandbox.md` §7.4).
//!
//! AI shell tools that need allowlisted outbound network access route through
//! a short-lived local HTTP/CONNECT proxy in [`super::proxy_runtime`]. This
//! module keeps the policy decision surface pure and testable:
//!
//! 1. The sandbox runtime can route through a `&dyn NetworkProxy` without
//!    depending on the transport implementation.
//! 2. Tests and the `Denied`-mode fallback can use [`NoopProxy`] (deny
//!    everything) without opening sockets.
//! 3. [`AllowlistProxy`] evaluates host / port / protocol rules used by the
//!    runtime proxy before any TCP forwarding happens.
//!
//! All implementations are `dyn`-safe and implement `Debug` so the
//! sandbox runtime can reuse one diagnostic envelope type for all
//! backends.
