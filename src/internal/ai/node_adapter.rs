//! DAG node adapters for AI agents.
//!
//! This module is the bridge layer between the high-level AI agent runtime and the
//! lower-level `dagrs` DAG executor. By implementing the `dagrs::Action` trait on
//! agent-shaped wrappers, callers can drop an LLM-driven agent into any node of an
//! orchestrated workflow alongside non-AI nodes (shell tasks, file operations,
//! gates) without leaking AI concerns into the executor itself.
//!
//! # Adapters
//!
//! - [`AgentAction`]: Wraps a single [`Agent`] for one-shot prompt-response execution
//!   within a DAG node.
//! - [`ToolLoopAction`]: Wraps the iterative tool-calling loop ([`run_tool_loop`]) within
//!   a DAG node, allowing the agent to invoke tools repeatedly until a final answer is produced.
//!
//! # Data Flow
//!
//! Both adapters follow the same input/output pattern:
//! 1. **Input**: Collect string outputs from all upstream nodes and concatenate them
//!    with `"\n\n"` as a separator to form a single prompt.
//! 2. **Execution**: Run the agent (or tool loop) with the assembled prompt.
//! 3. **Output**: Broadcast the agent's response to all downstream nodes.
//!
//! Non-string upstream payloads are skipped with a warning: this keeps the adapter
//! resilient when a sibling DAG node emits structured data, but it does mean callers
//! must coerce structured outputs to `String` if they want the agent to see them.

///   convert this into `Output::execution_failed` so the DAG executor sees the
///   failure rather than letting the node silently emit an empty prompt.
