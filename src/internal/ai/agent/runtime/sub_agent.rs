//! Sub-agent dispatcher contract — types and trait definitions only.
//!
//! This module is the OC-Phase 3 P3.2 deliverable from
//! `docs/improvement/opencode.md`. It defines the **vocabulary** that
//! P3.3 → P3.7 will fill in: a [`SubAgentDispatcher`] trait that the tool
//! loop forwards `task` calls into, the [`DispatchContext`] that carries
//! the parent-session state the dispatcher needs, and the
//! [`TaskInvocation`] / [`TaskResult`] / [`TaskFailure`] types that bound
//! the call shape on either side.
//!
//! What this module is:
//! - Pure data and trait definitions. No runtime implementation, no
//!   registration into the tool loop, no `code.multi_agent.enabled` gate.
//!   The dispatcher landing in P3.3+ will live next to or replace this
//!   file.
//! - Forward-stable shapes the doc commits to. Any field rename here
//!   has to update the contract section of `opencode.md` first.
//!
//! What this module is **not**:
//! - It does not register the `task` tool — that is OC-Phase 3 P3.1's
//!   `ToolSpec::task()` constructor, gated separately.
//! - It does not implement the 14-step dispatcher main flow from the
//!   doc — that lands in P3.3 / P3.4 / P3.7.
//! - It does not own the runtime services it references
//!   ([`PermissionService`], [`ContextFrameLoader`]). Those are
//!   placeholder shells that the real wiring PRs replace; their **names
//!   and method signatures** are the future contract, not the bodies.

/// - Honours `ctx.abort_token.is_cancelled()` pre-call so a parent
///   abort that fires before we hand off to the provider does not
///   leak a stale request to the wire.
///
/// What this runner does NOT do (yet):
/// - No tool loop. The child cannot call `read_file`, `apply_patch`,
///   or any other tool today; that wiring lands as a follow-up.
/// - No `ContextHandoff`. The child sees only the `invocation.prompt`
///   user message; parent transcript replay arrives with the handoff
///   builder integration.
/// - No child JSONL session. The runner does not write child
///   per-turn events; the dispatcher continues to write only the
