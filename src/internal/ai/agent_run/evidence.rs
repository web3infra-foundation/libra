//! `AgentEvidence[E]` event — wraps the persistent `Evidence` snapshot with
//! sub-agent provenance fields required by S2-INV-12 (raw fact chain) and
//! Step 2.8 evidence query.
//!
//! # R-A4 disambiguation note
//!
//! There are two `EvidenceKind` types in this codebase, both legitimate but
//! semantically different:
//!
//! - `git_internal::internal::object::evidence::EvidenceKind` — the
//!   persistent classification stored on the `Evidence` snapshot
//!   (`Test` / `Lint` / `Build` / `Other(String)`). This is what we wrap.
//! - `crate::internal::ai::runtime::contracts::EvidenceKind` — a runtime-side
//!   classification used by Phase 3/4 dispatch
//!   (`Test` / `Lint` / `Build` / `Security` / `Performance` / various
//!   internal failure variants). Used only as a tag; not the schema source.
//!
//! Per the audit closure, callers that need both types in the same file
//! MUST `use ... as ...` to avoid name collisions. We follow that pattern
//! below.
