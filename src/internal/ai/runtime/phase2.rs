//! Phase 2 Execution — formal write helpers (schema-only landing).
//!
//! 阶段 2 执行 — 正式写入助手（仅模式落地）。
//!
//! The Code UI Phase Workflow models Phase 2 as the **Execution** phase: a
//! [`TaskExecutionContext`] is dispatched to a [`TaskExecutor`], runs a
//! single task attempt, and produces a [`TaskExecutionResult`] alongside the
//! attempt-lifecycle formal writes (start / finish / patchset / evidence).
//!
//! # Runtime-owned contract, transitional storage
//!
//! [`AttemptWriteOutcome`], [`write_attempt_start`], and
//! [`write_attempt_finish`] are the pure Runtime-owned Phase 2 contract
//! surface. [`write_attempt_start_with_session`] and
//! [`write_attempt_finish_with_session`] currently delegate into
//! [`crate::internal::ai::orchestrator::persistence::ExecutionAuditSession`]
//! so the existing Run / TaskEvent / RunEvent / PlanStepEvent plumbing stays
//! in the orchestrator persistence layer while provider/UI callers target the
//! Runtime entry points. Once that storage code is folded into this module,
//! callers keep the same outcome type and lifecycle semantics.
//!
//! The important invariant is that a start write creates or reuses exactly one
//! persisted attempt run for the logical task, and a finish write appends the
//! terminal lifecycle facts against that same run id.
