//! Thread projection types for the Libra runtime layer.
//!
//! These records do not replace immutable `Intent` history. They materialize
//! the current conversational view over an Intent DAG so Libra can resume the
//! active branch, render participants, and track thread-local metadata without
//! rewriting snapshot objects.
//!
//! SQLite persistence stores projection timestamps at second granularity.
//! Sub-second precision is intentionally discarded because these rows are
//! rebuildable current-state views rather than immutable audit facts.
//!
//! Projection rows are optional runtime caches. Callers that receive `Ok(None)`
//! for a thread lookup should treat that as "projection missing" and attempt a
//! rebuild from immutable history rather than assuming the thread does not
//! exist.
