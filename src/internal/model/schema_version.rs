//! SeaORM entity for the `schema_versions` table managed by
//! [`crate::internal::db::migration::MigrationRunner`].
//!
//! One row per applied migration. Rows are inserted by
//! `MigrationRunner::run_pending` and removed by
//! `MigrationRunner::rollback_to`. Application code should treat this table
//! as **runner-owned** and never insert / delete rows directly — doing so
//! desyncs the runner's view of "current version".
