//! SeaORM entity for the [`source_call_log`](../../../../sql/migrations/2026052301_source_call_log.sql)
//! table — persistent telemetry of every external Source / MCP /
//! OpenAPI call routed through [`SourcePool`].
//!
//! Migrations land via `sql/migrations/2026052301_source_call_log{,_down}.sql`
//! and the entity is registered in [`crate::internal::model`].
//!
//! Producer is [`crate::internal::ai::sources::SourceCallLog`] (today
//! the in-memory `Mutex<Vec<SourceCallRecord>>` shape from v0.16.x);
//! v0.17.800 adds the on-disk shape so a session crash no longer
//! drops the audit trail.
